Dynamic Programming:
General Powerful algorithm design technique.
Specially good and intended for optimization problems.
Eg:
Minimization, Maximization

"Careful bruteforce".(Try all possiblities carefully :) )

Optimal substructure:

A problem has a optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be
constructed efficiently from optimal solutions of its sub problems.

We can solve bigger problems given the solutions to its smaller sub
problems.
